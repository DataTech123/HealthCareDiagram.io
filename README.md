The healthcare data project ERD diagram is designed to model a healthcare database in SSMS, facilitating SQL queries and Python scripts in VS Code.

The ERD diagram defines entities, columns, and records based on a common patient transaction system.
It represents an example created using Microsoft Visio to illustrate primary keys, foreign keys, one-to-many, and one-to-one relationships between tables.
