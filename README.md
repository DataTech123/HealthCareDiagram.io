This is just for an example skill to use visio software for a healthcare data project's ERD (entity relaitonship diagram) diagram, which will use for a healthcare database in SSMS, facilitating SQL queries and Python scripts in VS Code.

The ERD diagram defines entities, columns, and records based on a common patient transaction system, as part of a college project assignment. In a real workplace, based on a different work system diagram design will vary depending on a specific work system information configurartion.

It represents an example created using Microsoft Visio to illustrate primary keys, foreign keys, one-to-many, and one-to-one relationships between tables.

Thank you for your review and questions for further development.
