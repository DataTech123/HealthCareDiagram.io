The purpose of this  project design is just used for an example skill in visio software with  a healthcare data project's ERD (entity relaitonship diagram) diagram. It could be used for design a healthcare database in SSMS, facilitating SQL queries and Python scripts in VS Code.

The ERD diagram defines entities, columns, and records based on a common patient transaction system, as part of a college project assignment. In a real workplace, based on a different work system diagram design will vary depending on a specific work system information configurartion.

It represents an example created using Microsoft Visio to illustrate primary keys, foreign keys, one-to-many, and one-to-one relationships between tables.

Thank you so much for your  comments and any questions for further development.
